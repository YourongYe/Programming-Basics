# Instance Attributes
Instance attributes are owned by the specific instances of a class. 
This means for two different instances the instance attributes are usually different.

# Class Attributes
Class attributes are attributes which are owned by the class itself. They will be shared by all the instances of the class. 
Therefore they have the same value for every instance.

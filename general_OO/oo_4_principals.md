# Encapsulation
Encapsulation is defined as wrapping up of data and information under a single unit. In Object Oriented Programming, Encapsulation is defined as binding together the data and the functions that manipulates them.
It can restrict direct access to some of the object's components

Benefit:   
avoid duplications, easy to maintain  
the object need not reveal all its attributes and behaviors

# Polymorphism 
Not always happens along with abstract class
A base type pointer, when we use it to call a function, it can decide whether to call the base class virtual function or the 
derived class virtual function at runtime. 

# Abstraction
Data abstraction refers to providing only essential information about the data to the outside world, hiding the background details or implementation.

# Inheritance
A class can derive from a base class to have its features (member variables and functions).
Inheritance can be public, protected and private.

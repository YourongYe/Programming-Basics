# Different types of binary trees
### Full Binary Tree 
A Binary Tree is full if every node has 0 or 2 children. Following are examples of a full binary tree.   
We can also say a full binary tree is a binary tree in which all nodes except leaves have two children.

### Complete Binary Tree
A Binary Tree is complete Binary Tree if all levels are completely filled except   
possibly the last level and the last level has all keys as left as possible

### Perfect Binary Tree 
A Binary tree is Perfect Binary Tree in which all internal nodes have two children and all leaves are at the same level.

### Balanced Binary Tree
A binary tree is balanced if the height of the tree is O(Log n) where n is the number of nodes.

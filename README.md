(2)Can python be also compiled?

2.Pass by reference vs pass by value

3.Recursion vs Iteration

4.Integer

# Object-oriented programming 
1.Class

2.Member variables

3.Class Methods (functions)

4.Public, Protected and Private

5.Constructor and Destructor

6.Virtual function

7.Difference between override and overload

8.polymophysm

9.Object-oriented Concepts: (1)Encapsulation (2)Inheritance (3)Polymorphism (4)Abstraction

10.Diamond Inheritance

C++(virtual inheritance) Python ("Method Resolution Order" MRO)

# Python specifics

### OO programming
1.Class Attributes

2.Static and Class Method

4.Decorator

5.Properties

6.Iterator vs Generator

7.Slot

8.“With” Statement

### data structures
1.List Deepcopy

2.Lambda, map, reduce and filter

3.List Comprehensions 

# Data Structures
1.Array vs Linked-list

2.Hashtable

(1)Hashing (How hash table works?)

(2)Hash table real size (buffering)

(3)Collision (How hash table avoids collisions?)

# Multithreading
1.Python multithreading? 

not really. python has GIL (lock). Solution(Cpython, multiprocessing)

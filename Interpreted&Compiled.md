# Interpreted Programming Language:
The interpreter executes the program directly, translating each statement into a sequence of one or more subroutines, 
and then into another language (often machine code).

# Compiled Programming Language:
Compilers (translators that generate machine code from source code),compiling a program into machine-language instructions.

# Difference:
Compiled programs generally run faster than interpreted ones 
because interpreted programs must be reduced to machine instructions at runtime

# Interpreted Programming Language:
Implementations are interpreters. 
The interpreter executes the program directly, translating each statement into machine code/instructions. Translation happens at runtime. The code is saved in the same format as you entered. 

# Compiled Programming Language:
Implementations are compilers.
Compilers (translators that generate machine code from source code),compiling a program into machine-language instructions.
The program is complied before the execution happens. The code is complied and then saved as an executable file.

# Difference:
Compiled programs generally run faster than interpreted ones.
Because each line of an interpreted program must be translated to machine instructions each time it is executed (at runtime)

# Advantages for Compiled Programming Language

fast execution
optimised for the target hardware

# Disadvantages for Compiled Programming Language

require a compiler
editing the code is a lot slower than interpreters.
